This is a basic e-commerce site built using EJS templating and Node.js.  I created artboard designs for the inital concept using Sketch.  I built the site using BootStrap 5.0.0 for product card and general page layout.  The Home page features a horizontal scrollmenu of product images linked to the product pages.  This test-site is active at this address: https://stormy-springs-10135.herokuapp.com/.  It currently does not have ecommerce functionality, ie. Add to Cart, Checkout.  This was meant as a simple design excercise and an attempt to recreate a site that looks visually similar to one built in Wix by the site's owner.
