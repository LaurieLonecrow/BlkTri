# BlkTri
This is a basic e-commerce site that was meant as a simple design excercise to recreate a site that looks visually similar to one built in Wix by the site's owner.  

## Tech Stack
I created artboard designs for the inital concept using Sketch.  I built the frontend using BootStrap for product cards and general page layout/responsiveness.  I used EJS templating and Express/Node.js framework.
