# BlkTri
This is a basic e-commerce site built using EJS templating and Express framework.  I created artboard designs for the inital concept using Sketch.  I built the site using BootStrap for product card and general page layout.  This project is active at: https://stormy-springs-10135.herokuapp.com/.  This was meant as a simple design excercise to recreate a site that looks visually similar to one built in Wix by the site's owner.
